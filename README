transmission-add

Dependencies:
-------------
Python 2.6, at least
pygtk > 2.0
transmissionrpc (http://bitbucket.org/blueluna/transmissionrpc/wiki/Home)

General:
--------
transmission-add is a simple gui app to add torrents to different 
transmission daemons easily.

It's intended to be used with a web browser. I wrote it because there's no way
for the browser to distinguish which server you want to add a particular 
torrent to (i.e., video to a media server, iso to regular desktop)

Installation:
-------------

Copy to a bin folder of your choice. Personally, I make a symbolic link from ~/bin/
Then, run chmod +x on the script.
After that, configure your browser to run .torrent files with my script.

Configuration:
--------------

Configuration is done in the main.py file. Simply open it, the configuration 
options are all at the top. If you would like to see a real config file 
created for this program, see the AUTHORS file.
